# Music Releases
This week's project is to use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases.

## The problem

We used React for the first time this week and as a team of 3 we broke down the project into pieces on Trello. This helped us keep track of it. Our first problem was getting our artist to .map properly so that multiple artists appeared. We solved this through google and looking at other's project code, and then decided to combine artists inside the Album component. We also had problem getting the overlay to work with buttons but eventually discovered some errors in the code format. 

If we had more time, we would like to try and map the information directly from the api and do playlists.
